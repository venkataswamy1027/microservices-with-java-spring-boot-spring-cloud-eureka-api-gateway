# Microservices with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
If you are working with Spring Boot and building REST APIs then this course is for you. Having microservices is the new trend. <br />
In this course before jumping to microservices first you will understand what is monolithic application ? <br />
We will create microservices out of monolithic application so that you have better idea how to break your application and create microservices out of it. <br />
After that you will learn to use WebClient to make REST calls between your microservices. You might have used Rest Template but that is now deprecated and Spring 5 onwards it is not recommended to use. <br />
